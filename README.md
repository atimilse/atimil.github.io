# Hello!

Iâ€™m a student at George Mason University majoring in Business with a concentration in Management of Information Systems, and minoring in Computational and Data Science. Iâ€™m passionate about turning raw data into strategic insights that drive better business decisions.

My skill set includes using Python and SQL for in-depth data analysis and actionable insights. Iâ€™ve also built a strong foundation in data visualization, with experience using both Power BI and Tableau to create clear, impactful dashboards that communicate complex stories effectively.

I hold the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP) certification, which has strengthened my understanding of cloud fundamentals and how cloud technologies support scalable, data-driven solutions. As I continue into a new academic year, Iâ€™m excited to expand my knowledge in areas like data warehousing and big data technologies (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka) through my CDS coursework.

Thanks for visiting my portfolioâ€”Iâ€™m excited to share my projects and growth with you!
